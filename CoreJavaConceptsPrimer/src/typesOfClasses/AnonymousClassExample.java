/**
 * Anonymous class is a class without a name that is declared and instantiated in a single expression. It is typically 
 * used when you need a one-time implementation of an interface or an abstract class.
 * 
 * âœ… Key Points
 * It does not have a name.
 * It is used where a class is needed only once.
 * It is usually declared inside a method or constructor.
 * It can extend a class or implement an interface.
 * It cannot have explicit constructors since it has no name.
