/**
 * A Singleton Class is a class that allows only one instance (object) to be created during the entire execution of a 
 * program.
 * Explanation of Each Approach:
 * 
 * Eager Initialization: The singleton instance is created at the time of class loading. Simple but can lead to resource 
 * wastage if the instance is never used.
 * 
 * Lazy Initialization: The instance is created only when it is required for the first time. Not thread-safe by default but 
 * avoids early instantiation.
 * 
 * Thread-Safe Singleton (Synchronized Method): Ensures that only one thread can access the method at a time, making it 
 * thread-safe. Slower performance due to method synchronization.
 * 
 * Double-Check Locking: Optimizes thread-safety by reducing the overhead of synchronized methods. Ensures that the instance 
 * is created only once in a multithreaded environment with better performance.
 * 
 * Bill Pugh Singleton: Uses a static inner helper class to hold the instance. Lazy-loaded and thread-safe without needing 
 * synchronization. This is considered the best approach.
 * 
 * Enum Singleton: Simplest way to implement a Singleton. Provides built-in serialization, thread-safety, and protection 
 * against reflection.
 * 
 * Key Points:
 * All approaches are valid depending on your needs.
 * Eager Initialization is good for simple use cases where resources arenâ€™t a concern.
 * Lazy Initialization is better when you want to create the instance only when needed.
 * Synchronized and Double-Check Locking provide thread safety in multithreaded environments.
 * Bill Pugh and Enum Singleton are the most effective and recommended implementations due to their simplicity, thread-safety, and resource management.
