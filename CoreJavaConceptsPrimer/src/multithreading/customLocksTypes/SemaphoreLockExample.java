/**
 * It allow number of threads to acquire lock at same time using Semaphore lock = new Semaphore(2)
 * this 2 is nothing but permit to thread to go inside and acquire lock at same time 
 * 
 * Expected output
 * Lock acquired by: Thread-1
 * Lock acquired by: Thread-2
 * Lock released by: Thread-1
 * Lock acquired by: Thread-3
 * Lock released by: Thread-2
 * Lock acquired by: Thread-4
 * Lock released by: Thread-3
 * Lock released by: Thread-4
 * 
 * but getting little different output might be different due to context switching.
 * 
 * Example where to use this lock -> Consider a simple example where we want to control access to a shared printer 
 * resource with only two printers available. Weâ€™ll use a semaphore to ensure that no more than two threads can 
 * access the printer at the same time.
