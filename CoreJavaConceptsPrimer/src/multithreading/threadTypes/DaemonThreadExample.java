/**
* -> A daemon thread runs in the background and terminates when all non-daemon threads(non daemon thread means user 
* thread) complete. Itâ€™s suitable for background tasks like logging or monitoring.
* -> daemonThread is a daemon thread (set with .setDaemon(true)).
* -> The main thread completes after 2 seconds, causing the daemon thread to stop automatically.
* -> The daemon thread runs a background task but stops immediately when the main thread finishes.
