/**
 * The SOLID principles are five design principles for creating well-structured and maintainable object-oriented code. Here's a simple explanation:

S - Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)
A class should have only one reason to change, meaning it should only do one thing or have one responsibility.

O - Open/Closed Principle (OCP)
Code should be open for extension but closed for modification. You should be able to add new functionality without changing existing code.

L - Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)
Objects of a parent class should be replaceable with objects of a child class without affecting the correctness of the program.

I - Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)
A class should not be forced to implement interfaces it doesnâ€™t use. Break down large interfaces into smaller ones.

D - Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)
High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should depend on abstractions (e.g., interfaces).
