/**
 * Comparator Interface:
 * The Comparator interface in Java provides a way to define multiple ways to compare and sort objects. Unlike the 
 * Comparable interface, which allows only a single natural ordering, Comparator is designed to offer flexibility by 
 * allowing multiple sorting strategies. This makes it particularly useful for scenarios where objects need to be sorted 
 * in different ways.
 * 
 * Overview:
 * -> The Comparator interface defines a single method, compare(), which compares two objects and returns:
 * -> A negative integer if the first object is less than the second object
 * -> Zero if the first object is equal to the second object.
 * -> A positive integer if the first object is greater than the second object.
 * -> This method provides a way to define custom ordering for objects without modifying the class itself.
 * 
 * How Comparator Allows for Multiple Ways of Ordering Objects:
 * -> The Comparator interface allows you to create multiple Comparator instances, each defining a different ordering for 
 * objects. This flexibility means you can sort objects by various attributes or in different orders without altering the 
 * object's class.
 * 
 * Letâ€™s implement multiple Comparator instances for the Person class. We'll define comparators for sorting by name, by age, 
 * and by weight. First, we need to update the Person class to include getters and ensure that attributes are accessible.
