/**
 * Java program that demonstrates the usage of three different types of ExecutorService: a Fixed Thread Pool, 
 * a Cached Thread Pool, and a Single Thread Executor.
 * 
 * Explanation of Each Example:
 * 
 * 1) Fixed Thread Pool:
 * -> FixedThreadPool creates a fixed number of threads (in this case, 3).
 * -> Any extra tasks beyond the number of available threads wait until a thread becomes free.
 * -> The output shows tasks being executed by up to 3 threads concurrently.
 * 
 * 2) Cached Thread Pool:
 * -> CachedThreadPool creates new threads as needed but reuses previously constructed threads when theyâ€™re available.
 * -> There is no limit on the number of threads; it dynamically manages threads based on the tasks.
 * -> Tasks may run on different threads if threads are idle, or on newly created ones if more threads are needed.
 * 
 * 3) Single Thread Executor:
 * -> SingleThreadExecutor uses a single thread to execute tasks in sequence, ensuring only one task runs at a time.
 * -> This is useful for scenarios where you need sequential task execution.
 * -> All tasks are handled by the same thread, which is evident in the output.
 * 
 * RUN THIS ROGRAM YOU AR EABLE TO UNDERSTAND
