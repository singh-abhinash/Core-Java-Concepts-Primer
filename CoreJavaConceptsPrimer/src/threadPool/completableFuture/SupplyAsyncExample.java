/**
 * -> supplyAsync() runs a task asynchronously and returns a CompletableFuture that holds the result of that task.
 * -> Itâ€™s useful for initiating a computation that produces a result (like fetching data from an API).
 * 
 * Code Explanation:
 * 
 * Creating an Asynchronous Task:
 * -> CompletableFuture<Integer> supplyTask = CompletableFuture.supplyAsync(() -> { ... });
 * -> A CompletableFuture object named supplyTask is created.
 * -> The supplyAsync method is called, which executes the provided lambda expression asynchronously. This means the 
 * task will run in a separate thread, managed by the Java thread pool.
 * -> Inside the lambda expression, it prints the current thread name using Thread.currentThread().getName() and 
 * returns the integer value 20.
 * -> the task inside supplyAsync() runs asynchronously, and the result (20) is stored in the CompletableFuture 
 * object, future.
 * 
 * Blocking the Main Thread:
 * supplyTask.join();
 * -> This line causes the main thread (the thread executing the main method) to block and wait until the supplyTask 
 * is completed.
 * -> The join method is a blocking call that ensures that the main thread will not proceed until the asynchronous 
 * task has finished execution. It is similar to calling get() on the CompletableFuture, but join() does not throw 
 * checked exceptions.
