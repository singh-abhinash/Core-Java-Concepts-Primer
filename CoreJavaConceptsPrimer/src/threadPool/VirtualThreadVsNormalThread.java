/**
 * Virtual Threads:
 * -> Lightweight: Virtual threads are very light and can handle many tasks at once without using much memory.
 * -> Managed by the JVM: They are controlled by the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) instead of the operating system, 
 * making them easier to manage.
 * -> Easy to Use: You can write code that looks simple and straightforward, even if it's running many tasks at the 
 * same time.
 * -> Good for Asynchronous Tasks: They help you run tasks that might take a long time (like downloading files) 
 * without blocking your main program.
 * 
 * Normal Threads:
 * -> Heavyweight: Normal threads use more resources and memory, so you can run fewer of them at the same time.
 * -> Managed by the Operating System: They are controlled by the operating system, which can make them slower to 
 * manage.
 * -> More Complex: Writing code for normal threads can be trickier, especially when dealing with tasks that run at 
 * the same time.
 * -> Requires Careful Management: You need to be careful to avoid problems when multiple threads try to access the 
 * same resources.
 * 
 * Summary:
 * In short, virtual threads are a newer, easier, and more efficient way to handle many tasks at once in Java, while 
 * normal threads are the traditional method that can be more complex and resource-heavy.
